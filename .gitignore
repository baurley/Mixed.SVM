# If data is immutable, it doesn't need source control in the same
# way that code does. Therefore, by default, the data folder is included
# in the .gitignore file. If you have a small amount of data that rarely
# changes, you may want to include the data in the repository. Github
# currently warns if files are over 50MB and rejects files over 100MB.
# Some other options for storing/syncing large data include AWS S3 with a
# syncing tool (e.g., s3cmd), Git Large File Storage, Git Annex, and dat.
# Currently by default, we ask for an S3 bucket and use AWS CLI to sync
# data in the data folder with the server.
